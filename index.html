            <p>I am a born and raised Utahn currently living in Sandy, Utah. I graduated from Brighton High School in 2002 and attended 
                the University of Utah. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Political Science. I then completed a master's degree in 
                Elementary Education. </p>
            <p>I have been teaching for the past 11 years at Monte Vista Elementary in South Jordan, Utah. I taught 6th grade for 7 years 
                and 5th grade in the Dual Language Immersion program during the last 5 years. </p> 
            <p>Soccer is my passion. I'm an avid supporter of Liverpool FC, and the English Premier League in general. When it comes
                to playing soccer, most of my teammates always mention at the end of the game, "great running". I claim that as my biggest
                strength and anything else you get from me is a bonus. I also enjoy playing or watching any other sport.
            </p>
